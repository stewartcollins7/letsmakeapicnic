Let's Have A Picnic (letsmakeapicnic repo but I changed the name for the final app)

Let's Have A Picnic is an android app I developed in Android Studio. The idea is that if you are walking around and suddenly have a desire to have a picnic, it will help you out! Using google places it will search for the closest parks around. You can also specify the start or end points of the trip or choose from surrounding parks. You can have the options to calculate the route via a liquor store or supermarket if you need to grab some extras or are completely unprepared. This can filter for shops that are only open, or you can set the day and it will show the opening hours for that shop on that day. It will then calculate the most efficient way to get you picnicking straight away! 

Uses Kotlin, Android Studio, Google Places API, Google Directions API, Google Maps, Retrofit and RxAndroid
